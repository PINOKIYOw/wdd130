        <p>Yo! I'm Lwazi Lubisi from Krugersdorp, South Africa. I am a Software Development student in BYU-Pathway
            Worldwide and I love coding. What got me so interested in programming was my undying love for video games
            and evolving technology. I love making music too. I could listen to music all day and it helps me code so
            much better when it is playing in the background. I love making people smile and I think I could do so by
            programming life-changing software. I am very grateful to be a part of this venture. All glory to The Most
            High.</p>

        <p>South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. Its nine
            provinces are bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometers (1,739 miles) of coastline that stretches along the
            South
            Atlantic and Indian Ocean; to the north by the neighboring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; to
            the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini; and it encloses Lesotho.</p>
