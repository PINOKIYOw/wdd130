        <p>Yo! I'm Lwazi Lubisi from Krugersdorp, South Africa. I am a Software Development student in BYU-Pathway
            Worldwide and I love coding. What got me so interested in programming was my undying love for video games
            and evolving technology. I love making music too. I could listen to music all day and it helps me code so
            much better when it is playing in the background. I love making people smile and I think I could do so by
            programming life-changing software. I am very grateful to be a part of this venture. All glory to The Most
            High.</p>
